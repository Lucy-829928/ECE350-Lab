## test0
Compilation & compatibility with evaluation framework ~ calls osKernelInit, k_mem_init, and printf.

### expected output
```
---- test0 ----
PASS: build successful
<serial timeout>
<end of test>
```
### your output
```
<build failed>

```
### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test1
Cooperative multitasking still works — several tasks created using osCreateTask, which call osYield (after at least 1ms of execution time but before its deadline), will take turns in a Round Robin fashion (e.g. demo 1 of features post)

### expected output

### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test2
If a task never yields, when its deadline is reached the kernel will pre-empt it (with the currently most urgent task). When the task is resumed later it will continue from where it was interrupted.

### expected output
```
---- test2 ----
A0 =0, B0 =0
A1 =[8000-40000], B1 =1
A2 =[16000-80000], B2 =2
A3 =[24000-120000], B3 =3
A4 =[32000-160000], B4 =4
<serial timeout>
<end of test>
```
### your output
```
<build failed>

```
### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test3
Task stacks are created dynamically using k_mem_alloc, and are freed on osTaskExit. (If the heap is exhausted the task will not be created and will return RTX_ERR.)

### expected output
```
---- test3 ----
creating tasks with 0x2000 stack size until stack space is exhausted...
created task with tid-1, stack_high=0x2000cc30
created task with tid-2, stack_high=0x2000ec40
created task with tid-3, stack_high=0x20010c50
PASS: osCreateTask failed (expected)

starting tasks...

task-2
stack_high: 0x2000ec40
exiting

task-3

stack_high of created task: 0x2000ec40
PASS: task stack freed & reused

task-4
<serial timeout>
<end of test>
```
### your output
```
<build failed>

```
### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test4
Several tasks created using osCreateDeadlineTask with different deadlines will be started according to the order of "earliest deadline first"

### expected output
```
---- test4 ----

fourth
<serial timeout>
<end of test>
```
### your output
```
<build failed>

```
### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test5
One task can run periodically via osPeriodYield (e.g. slide 1 of clarifications post)

### expected output
```
---- test5 ----

## test7
A simple task created with osCreateTask can use osSleep to run occasionally according to an arbitrary time schedule. 

### expected output
```
---- test7 ----
Using DWT for timing

Task started
osSleep 5 ms
Awake1 delta time =[4000-6000] us
osSleep 21 ms
Awake2 delta time =[20000-22000] us
osSleep 300 ms
Awake3 delta time =[299000-301000] us
osSleep 1 ms
Awake4 delta time =[100-2000] us

<serial timeout>
<end of test>
```
### your output
```
<build failed>

```
### your score: 0.00/1.00

## test8
Using osSetDeadline to make another task more urgent than the RUNNING task will trigger a context switch. And that task's deadline is permanently changed in future iterations. 

### expected output
